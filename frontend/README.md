# Frontend setup
1. Ensure you have the latest version of node and npm installed (this project was developed with node v22.19.0 and npm version 10.9.3).
2. Clone the project.
3. In the frontend directory, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` commands. **You must use the Vite build tool to run this project.**
4. You should now see a localhost link in your terminal. Click it and you should see the frontend open in your browser.

The above instructions have been tested to work in Windows 11 24H2 and Ubuntu 22.04.5 (in WSL).
